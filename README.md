A simple flashlight app for Android.  
It uses your camera's LED flashlight to let you see in the dark.

#### What permissions does this app need?

* **Camera**  
  Required to access the flashlight.

#### Why? There are plenty of other flashlight apps.

I created this app because I couldn't find a torch app that starts up fast and requires minimum permissions. Most of the other apps want to know your location and other things for no reason...
